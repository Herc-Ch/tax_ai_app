# Tax AI App

A full-stack web application for AI-powered tax advice.  
Frontend: React.  
Backend: Flask (Python) with OpenAI integration.  
**Develop and run easily with Docker and Docker Compose.**

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (Docker Recommended)

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- An OpenAI API key (format: `sk-...`)

---

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Herc-Ch/tax_ai_app.git
cd tax_ai_app
```

---

### 2. Setup your OpenAI API Key

Create a `.env` file in your project root with:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit your `.env` file or API keys to public repositories!

---

### 3. Build and Run the App (all with Docker!)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend API:** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## üê≥ Docker Overview

- **Frontend:** Uses Node.js to build your React app, then serves with Nginx for production.
- **Backend:** Runs Flask, handles form data and connects to OpenAI for tax advice.
- **No Python/Node/npm install required on your machine** ‚Äì all happens in the containers.

## üîó API Endpoints

Backend exposes endpoints at `http://localhost:5000/api/submit-tax`:

| Method | Endpoint                | Description                          | Example Body (JSON)                   |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| POST   | /api/submit-tax         | Submit new tax data                  | `{ "filing_status": "single", ... }`  |
| GET    | /api/submit-tax         | Get all tax data submissions         | ‚Äì                                     |
| PUT    | /api/submit-tax         | Update tax data at a given index     | `{ "index": 0, "income": 1500, ... }` |
| DELETE | /api/submit-tax?index=0 | Delete tax submission at given index | ‚Äì                                     |

**AI Advice:**  
POST `/api/ai-tax-advice` with your tax form fields to receive AI-generated advice.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Without Docker (Optional/Advanced)

You do **NOT** need to install Node, Python, or pip if using Docker!  
But for advanced local development:

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
python app.py
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## üìù Notes

- The backend stores data in memory (not persistent).
- For production: use HTTPS, proper secrets management, and persistent storage.
- All dependencies are installed inside containers when using Docker.

## üõ† Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate the testing and validation process with every code change.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Trigger**: The CI pipeline runs automatically on every `push` or `pull request` to the `main` branch.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Checkout Code** ‚Äì Retrieves the latest code from the repository.
  2. **Set Up Docker** ‚Äì Installs Docker and Docker Compose for building and running services.
  3. **Build and Start Services** ‚Äì Builds backend and frontend containers using `docker-compose`.
  4. **Run Backend Tests** ‚Äì Executes Python unit tests using `pytest` inside the backend container.
  5. **Linting** ‚Äì A separate job uses **Super-Linter** to check code quality and formatting for multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, CSS, Markdown, YAML, etc.).

### üîê Secrets

The pipeline uses the `OPENAI_API_KEY` stored as a GitHub Secret to run the backend in CI without exposing sensitive credentials.

I considered adding a conversational mode, where the user could ask follow-up questions or clarify their situation, and the AI would remember the context. This would turn the tool into a lightweight AI tax assistant, similar to ChatGPT but focused strictly on tax filing. For the scope of this project, I focused on one-shot advice to keep the experience simple and polished‚Äîbut the architecture can be easily extended for chat.

## üìù API Documentation with Swagger

This project includes **interactive API documentation** generated automatically with [Swagger (OpenAPI)](https://swagger.io/) using the [Flasgger](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger) library for Flask.

- **Access the API docs:**  
  Once the backend server is running, visit [http://localhost:5000/apidocs](http://localhost:5000/apidocs) in your browser.

- **Features:**
  - Explore all available API endpoints and methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
  - See required parameters, example requests, and response schemas.
  - Try out the endpoints live in your browser without any extra tools (no need for Postman).

**Swagger UI makes it easy for developers, interviewers, and non-technical users to understand, test, and interact with the API quickly and reliably.**

## üîí Data Privacy & Anonymity

This project uses a local **SQLite** database to store submitted tax information in an **anonymized** form for demonstration and aggregate statistical analysis purposes. No names, emails, or other identifying information are stored. You can explore or inspect the database directly using [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).

> **Note:**  
> If data is truly anonymized, it is no longer considered ‚Äúpersonal data‚Äù under GDPR.

- All data stored in the database is fully anonymized and cannot be linked back to any individual.
- This ensures ethical and legal compliance with modern privacy standards.
- Users are encouraged to review or analyze the anonymized data using standard SQLite tools.

**Your privacy and security are a top priority in this demo application.**

**Happy tax filing with AI!**
